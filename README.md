# Zotero RAG Plugin

This plugin implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) System for Zotero which allows to ask questions on the literature in a library and get a response with links to the sources.

## Quick Start

### Install the dependencies

- [Install `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you don't have it already.
- Install the python dependencies: `uv sync`
- Install a recent version of NodeJS (It's strictly only necessary for development)

### 2. Start the Backend Server

The plugin requires a local server to process your questions. Start it with:

```bash
# with NodeJS:
npm run server:start
# without NodeJS:
uv run python scripts/server.py start 
```

The server will run at <http://localhost:8119>. You can check if it's running:

```bash
# with NodeJS:
npm run server:status
# without NodeJS:
uv run python scripts/server.py status
```

To stop the server later:

```bash
# with NodeJS:
npm run server:stop
# without NodeJS:
uv run python scripts/server.py stop
```

### 3. Install the Plugin in Zotero

1. Download the `zotero-rag-X.Y.Z.xpi` file from https://github.com/cboulanger/zotero-rag/releases/latest
2. Open Zotero
3. Go to **Tools → Add-ons**
4. Click the gear icon and select **Install Add-on From File**
5. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file
6. Restart Zotero when prompted

### 4. Using the Plugin

Once installed:

1. Open your Zotero library
2. Select a library (user or group)
3. Open the "Tools" menu and then click on the "Zotero RAG" menu item
4. In the dialog, the current library will be pre-selected, but you can add additional ones to search.
5. Ask questions that can be answered by the PDF documents contained in the selected libraries
6. The plugin will search through your documents and provide answers with source citations. The initial indexing of the library might take some time depending on the server hardware, subsequent queries will be much faster.

The plugin uses AI to understand your questions and retrieve relevant information from your Zotero library, making it easy to find insights across multiple papers.
