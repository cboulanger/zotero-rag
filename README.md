## Quick Start

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests (fast, no setup required)
npm run test:backend

# With coverage report
npm run test:backend:coverage
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests validate the system with real Zotero and live API services.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Zotero running with test group synced: https://www.zotero.org/groups/6297749/test-rag-plugin
2. API key configured (e.g., KISSKI_API_KEY)

```bash
# Quick health check
npm run test:integration:quick

# Full integration suite
npm run test:integration

# Everything (unit + integration)
npm run test:all
```

See [Integration Testing Quick Start](docs/integration-testing-quickstart.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Backend Server

```bash
# Start development server
npm run server:start

# Check status
npm run server:status

# Stop server
npm run server:stop
```
